# InTo 

InTo stands for Infodemiological Tomograph. It aims to use the sentiment of social media content about public health crises to forecast public health pressure. This current version uses the positivity associated with tweets about the 2019 novel coronavirus to forecast hospital presure. The vision is to improve and extend the capabilities of this tool to enable public health officials to save lives regardless of the country, social media content source and public health crisis.
